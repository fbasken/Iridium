To play:

TRON is a multiplayer game where two players are represented by moving dots that leave an infinite trail.
Players steer their dots orthogonally-- left, right, up, and down.
Touching any line or the edge of the screen will result in being eliminated.
The game can be restarted once all players have crashed-- and the winner will be displayed.
Crashing into another player's trail awards them a knockout.
Upon getting multiple knockouts in a single round, a special voiceline will play! Keep your volume up!

Open the .pde file, and make sure the settings are how you like-- then click play.

The game supports 2 - 4 players at a variety of sizes and speeds.
To change the player number, change the variable called STARTING_PLAYERS -- set this to 2, 3 or 4.
To change the size of all players, modify the variable called c -- set this anywhere between 1 and 5.
Keep in mind that the size of players directly affects their speed.
To change the speed of players, change the speed variable.
