To play:

TRON is a multiplayer game where two players are represented by moving dots that leave an infinite trail.
Players steer their dots orthogonally-- left, right, up, and down.
Touching any line will result in being eliminated.
The game can be restarted once all players have crashed-- and the winner will be displayed.
Crashing into any player's trail awards them a knockout.
Upon getting multiple knockouts in a single round, a special voiceline will play! Keep your volume up! (Try to get 4 knockouts!)

Open the .pde file, then click the Run button.

The game supports 2 - 4 players at a variety of sizes and speeds.
To change the player number, press [2], [3] or [4].
To change the size of all players, press [+] or [-]. Hold [SHIFT] while pressing these to instead change the frames per move.
Keep in mind that the size of players directly affects their speed.
Toggle edge-teleporting with the backslash [\] key. Hold [SHIFT] while pressing it to toggle self-KO.
Clear scores and rounds by pressing both bracket keys simultaneously: [[] and []].
Change music with [SHIFT] + [,] or  [SHIFT] + [.]
